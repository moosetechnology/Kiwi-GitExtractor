# Kiwi-GitExtractor
A mini git information extractor. 
Welcome to the Kiwi GitExtractor. Kiwi is a convention to mean to you the user and reader that this project 
is not about analysing full Git and using FAMIX metamodel.
It means that this is a small project to be able to brainstorm and build some tools rapidly.
